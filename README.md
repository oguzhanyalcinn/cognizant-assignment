# Wiremock Basic

- When you run the application(OguzhanApplication.java), application will say "Hello, all API tests were successful" on http://localhost:8080/OguzhanApp
- Tests can be found in the tests package. All endpoints have been tested according to swagger file.
- I've used WireMock to create stubs. It's working on http://localhost:9876
